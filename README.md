## Projects
Here are some of the projects that you will find in this repository:

[Website Portfolio](https://github.com/Tfletcher7/DigitalFinalProject): My website portfolio is a responsive and visually appealing showcase of my web development projects and skills, built using HTML and CSS. It includes a homepage, projects section, about me section, and contact section, providing a professional and engaging platform for potential employers or clients to learn about me and my work.

[Python Testing](https://github.com/Tfletcher7/python_testing): I used Python testing to test a simple loan calculator that calculates the monthly payments and total cost of a loan based on user inputs such as loan amount, interest rate, and loan term. The tests were designed to ensure the accuracy and functionality of the loan calculator program.
